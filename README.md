# Awesome Learning from Experience (LfE)

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of research papers, frameworks, and resources dedicated to **Learning from Experience** in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Learning from experience focuses on how agents or models can improve their performance, reasoning, and decision-making by reflecting on past interactions, feedback, and historical data.
